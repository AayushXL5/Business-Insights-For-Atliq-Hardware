## üß© Mockup Design for Report Views

In business intelligence projects, product requirements are often communicated through rough sketches or informal discussions. In this case, the product owner provided an initial mockup that outlined expectations for how the report views should be structured. The mockup included placements for visual elements like graphs and key performance indicators (KPIs).

### üìä Report View Breakdown

#### **Finance View**
- **P&L Structure Report**: Displays gross sales to GM% in rows, with year and YoY% in columns.  
- **Performance Over Time (Line Chart)**: Compares the selected year vs. the previous year by month.  
- **Top & Bottom Market Matrix**: Shows Net Sales (NS) and YoY% in columns.  

#### **Sales View**
- **Top Customers (Matrix Format)**: Shows NS with year and YoY% in columns.  
- **Scatter Chart**: Plots GM% vs. NS% to identify performance trends.  
- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates category-wise sales distribution.  
- **Top Products (Matrix Format)**: Displays year-wise sales with YoY%.  

#### **Marketing View**
- **Top Products by Division (Matrix Format)**: Shows year-wise performance with YoY%.  
- **Scatter Chart**: Plots GM% vs. NS%.  
- **Unit Economics (Pie Chart)**: Breaks down cost structure.  
- **Top Market (Matrix Format)**: Displays year-wise performance with YoY%.  

#### **Supply View**
- **KPIs**: Includes Forecast Accuracy (FA) and Net Error (NE).  
- **Accuracy Over Time (Line Chart)**: Compares current FA with last year‚Äôs FA.  
- **Top & Bottom Customers (Matrix Format)**: Highlights forecast accuracy performance.  
- **Top & Bottom Products (Matrix Format)**: Displays forecast accuracy at the product level.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Limitation

For the financial year used in this project, data is only available up to the end of December. Post that period, only forecast values are available. As a result, it‚Äôs necessary to calculate landing estimates, Year-to-Date (YTD), and Year-to-Go (YTG) values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Importance of Mockups

Mockups are a vital visual tool for communication between stakeholders and developers. They help to:
- ‚úÖ Improve user experience by logically structuring reports  
- ‚úÖ Minimize misunderstandings  
- ‚úÖ Accelerate design approvals before development begins

## üß† Design Approach

To enhance clarity and user experience:
- Visuals were arranged using a **Z-shaped reading pattern** for better flow  
- Adequate spacing and alignment ensured readability  
- Formatting was kept consistent for a clean and professional layout

## üß∞ Mockup Creation Tools

Mockups can be created using:
- ‚úèÔ∏è Hand-drawn sketches for quick drafts  
- üñºÔ∏è Presentation tools for formal layouts  
- ü§ñ AI-powered design tools for high-precision mockups  

In this project, an AI-based design tool was used to convert the initial sketch into a polished, professional version of the report layout.
